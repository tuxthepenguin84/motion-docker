# motion-docker

This is an unofficial fork of https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion-docker.

## Caveats

- Probably several :) I'm new to docker but I'm building this for use in my home lab and wanted to share.

## How to run

See docker-compose*.yml files

There's a Alpine Dockerfile and docker-compose file that removes functionality (and reduces size) I do not use and there's a Ubuntu Dockerfile and docker-compose that's based on the .deb file

## Dockerhub

See https://hub.docker.com/r/tuxthepenguin/motion for different versions and tags
